Create an queue abstractoin for C programmers.

pthread_queue_t is the type.

void pthread_queue_init(pthread_queue_t*, int size);
	will initialize the queue.
	the queue size is the maximum number of messages on the queue.
void pthread_queue_put(pthread_queue_t*, void* msg);
	will put a message on the queue.
	If the queue is full then this method sleeps until there is room
	in the queue.
void* pthread_queue_get(pthread_queue_t*);
	get a message from the queue.
	blocks if the queue is empty.
void pthead_queue_destroy(pthread_queue_t*);
	destroy all resources having to do with the queue.

use pthread_condition and pthread_mutex to solve.
