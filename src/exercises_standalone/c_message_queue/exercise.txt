Write a multi-thread safe message queue to communicate
between threads.

The message queue should be an array of void* pointers.

Here is the API you should implement:

type:
	mq

API:
	int mq_init(mq*, const int maxsize);
		creates the queue with a maximum size of maxsize.
	int mq_destroy(mq*);
		destroys the queue (whatever is needed to be done).
	int mq_put(mq*, void*);
		put a message on the queue.
		goes to sleep if the queue is full.
	void* mq_get(mq*);
		get a message from the queue.
		goes to sleep if the queue is empty.

Demonstrate the use of this API.

make the mq type opaque so that changes to that type will not require recompilation
of your clients.
