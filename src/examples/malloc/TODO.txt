- do example of using the mtrace from glibc function.
- show that malloc always aligns it's return points to 4 or 8 bytes.
	(example that allocates memory chunks of random size and shows that
	the returned pointers from malloc are always 4 or 8 aligned).
malloc debuggers:
- memwatch http://www.linkdata.se/sourcecode.html
- yamd (yet another malloc debugger).
