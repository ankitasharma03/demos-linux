- I should be able to allocate a stack using mmap(2) with some parameters.
	I tried to do it and failed in the sense that pmap(1) shows my
	new mmap area as "[ anon ]" and not "[ stack ]".
	Why is that?
	Do an example that manages to allocte a stack which is marked as such.
	How do you mark it as such?
	It is a paremeter for mmap(2) or some prctl(2) or whatever?
	See how glibc does it by stracing a small executable.
