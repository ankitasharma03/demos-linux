- look at apt-cache search malloc
	there are many interesting things to show here.
- various replacements for malloc:
	here is a link:
	http://hackingheaven.com/
	there is a mmalloc library there - check it out.
		demo it.
	show example of mmalloc and it's use to reduce malloc contention for many core
		systems. This library allows to create many memory pools and thus we can
		create a pool per thread and thus have no contention between threads.
- demo slab allocation (is there a library for it ?!?)
- show an example of writing a good cache allocator with little contention (using spin locks for multi thread access).
- show how to map hugetlbfs pages (huge pages) into user memory.
